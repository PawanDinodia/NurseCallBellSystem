## What is a nurse call bell system
In a hospital environment whenever a patient in need of staff, she/he press a button that triggers a alarm at nursing station.The nurse respond and reach to the patient. The button and the alarm system together known as **Nurse calling system** and this is what the project all about.

## Problems with existing system
* The existing call bell system is based on **pure electronics**. It uses 7-segments, hardware push buttons and lots of circuitry.
  - This lead to additional cost of installation and maintenance. Hardware parts are usually wear and tear.
  - There is no way to get feedback form the patient. No way to create log the calls, respond time and other parameters.
  - The existing system looks really ugly and not fit for luxury environment of the hospital.
  - The alarm sound is also fixed by the manufacturer and cannot be changed throughout its life.
  - Usually the system is wired (not always).
  
## Solutions
  * Answer to all these questions is to use a CPU based system to remove all these problems and improve this situation.

## In this project
  * We are creating a Android app which will work as the client (The push button for the patient).
  * It also includes java desktop application which will work as a server and will be used at the nursing station.
## Benefits
  * As we can use touch screens and fully wireless system therefore, maintenance time and cost will definitely be reduced.
  * Logs can be made very easily and can be shown as beautiful graphical views.
  * Great themes can be used to fit the luxury environment of the hospital.
  * Any suitable Sound can be set for the alarm, which will be very pleasing, remove un-necessory noise and help to remove panics.
